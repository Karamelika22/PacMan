Pacman Game Overview:
Pacman game is a classic arcade-style adventure where players take on the role of Pacman, a yellow, circular character with a voracious appetite,so i want to try to create this popular for all decades game).
The primary goal is to guide Pacman through a maze filled with fruits while evading colorful ghosts. 
Players accumulate points by devouring fruits scattered across the maze, and the objective is to achieve the highest possible score.
However, encounters with ghosts lead to the loss of one of Pacman's lives. 
The game continues until Pacman exhausts all of his lives or successfully collects all the fruits, marking a victory.At this stage of game development i created based(important) files (in my opinion) in which will happen the main process of the game,charecters,initilised variables and etc.
I will create more support files in the sequel),bgitggut now i wanted to show you the first steps with this game.
